            <!--Cancellation Policy-->
            <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>We understand that sometimes plans change. If you wish to cancel your order, please inform us at least
                <b> 1 day before </b>the scheduled delivery time.
            </p>
            <p>To cancel your order, please contact us directly via the <a href="contactUs.html">Contact Us</a> page.
                Our team will assist you with the cancellation process.</p>
            <p>If the delivery man has already been dispatched and is on their way, cancellations will not be accepted.
                However, you can still refuse the order at the time of delivery, but in such cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will be charged the delivery fee and</li>
                <li>You will be required to pay <b>half of the total order amount </b> as a cancellation fee.</li>
            </ul>

            <!--Returns and Exchanges-->
            <h2>Returns and Exchanges</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, due to the perishable nature of our products, we cannot accept returns or exchanges after
                the vegetables have been delivered. Please inspect your order upon arrival to ensure everything is
                correct.</p>
            <p>If you receive damaged or incorrect items, please contact us within <b> 24 hours of delivery.</b> We
                will
                assess the issue and offer a suitable resolution, such as a replacement or refund, depending on the
                situation.</p>

            <!--Refund Policy-->
            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>If you are eligible for a refund due to an issue with your order (e.g., incorrect or damaged items), the
                refund will be processed through your original payment method. Please note the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Refunds will be processed within <b>7 business days </b> after approval.</li>
                <li>If a partial order is canceled, the refund will be based on the canceled items, excluding the
                    delivery fee.</li>
                <li>In cases where cancellation occurs after the delivery man has left the warehouse but before the
                    delivery is made, you will still be charged the delivery fee and a <b>half payment </b>cancellation
                    fee.</li>
            </ul>
